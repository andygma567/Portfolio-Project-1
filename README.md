# Portfolio-Project-1
My first portfolio project on data cleaning and machine learning for regression

# **Abstract**

Hi! 

My name is Andrew Ma, I've recently graduated from the University of Texas - Austin with a PhD in Mathematics. I'm seeking a new career in machine learning engineering. To this end I've put together this notebook in order to show off some of the skills in Machine Learning / Data Science with a regression problem. In this notebook I include a discussion on the topics of data cleaning, data preprocessing, building and tuning a neural net in tensorflow, tuning a lasso model (linear regression with an L1 weight), and feature engineering. I look at a small dataset that I got from Kaggle.
