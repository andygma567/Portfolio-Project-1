To this end I've put together this notebook in order to show off some of the skills in Machine Learning / Data Science with a regression problem. In this notebook I include a discussion on the topics of data cleaning, data preprocessing, building and tuning a neural net in tensorflow, tuning a lasso model (linear regression with an L1 weight), and feature engineering. I look at a small dataset that I got from Kaggle.\n",

        "The original dataset provided by Zillow for training contains over 2 million entries. My computational resources are limited to my personal laptop and the Google Colab notebooks. In an effort to accomdate my computational resources I've decided to work with just the first 1000 entries in the provided dataset \"properties_2016.csv\"\n",

        "On this smaller dataset, I clean the data, preprocess it with a Standard Scaler from scikit-learn, and then I train and tune a neural net built with tensorflow.keras and using a mean squared error loss function. I then compare my built neural net to a linear regression made with scikit-learn. \n",

The BayesOptimization Tuner searches the hyperparameter space more efficiently by using Bayes Optimization to make educated guesses on what hyperparameter settings to try based on previously tried hyperparameter settings (Please see Appendix for more information). It's interesting to note that the site (https://scikit-optimize.github.io/stable/index.html) offers Bayes Optimized Searching built for scikit-learn.  \n",

This process gets repeated until a single model is selected. ([Link to the 2016 ArXiv paper on Hyperband](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06560)).\n",
